    "ChapterLongDec":"We think that Porto as other great European cities has a growing number of startups, and we can be a big if not the biggest tech hub in Portugal. Having this in mind we though that something's missing in Porto that already exists on cities like London or Paris. A community of developers. We want to make it possible for the community to spread the knowledge between people in different companies, schools and universities. We want to be that bridge.",

Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons."
